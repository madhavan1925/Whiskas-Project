    <p>
        WHISKAS® brand has been making food for cats since 1958 and we use this experience in everything we do. Not only are we committed to developing delicious products, we’re devoted to helping all cats live healthy and happy lives. <br><br>

The WHISKAS® brand is there for the whole journey – as your cat grows with us, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our nutrition and care. <br><br>

As the makers of WHISKAS® we know and understand how much people love their cats – we feel the same. We love them for their independent spirits but understand they still need love and care. We believe the best way to help owners provide that care is through understanding a cat’s most natural instincts. These natural instincts can be seen in their often mysterious and intriguing behaviour and it is through studying this behaviour that we have developed a better understanding of our feline friends than anyone else, so that we can help owners provide the very best care to their cats. <br><br>

The makers of WHISKAS® pride themselves on producing food that give cat owners the reassurance they are feeding their cat a healthy and tasty diet. We work with the WALTHAM® Centre for Pet Nutrition to develop products that constantly improve nutrition and care. We ensure all our meals are full of the natural goodness your cat instinctively needs as well as always being nutritionally complete and balanced, helping the world’s cats to live healthier and happier lives.
