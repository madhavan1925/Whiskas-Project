    <h1><b>FAQ</b></h1>
    <h3>Product Information</h3>
    <h5>What is the proper way to store Whiskas Cat Food?</h5>
    <p>We recommend storing dry, or unopened wet WHISKAS® Cat Food products in a cool dry place, not subject to extreme hot or cold temperatures. Our dry products should not be stored in areas of humidity (washer, dryer, refrigerator, etc.) or near odorous materials (detergent, fertilizer, etc.). If possible, store our dry products in a plastic container (keep the product in the bag with top folded closed for best storage).</p>
    <h5>Can i feed the product after the best before date</h5>
    <p>All of our products have a best before date to help shops keep control of products on their shelves. When the date is passed, it doesn't mean that the food will be harmful. It might not be as nutritious and begin to lose its flavor and texture.</p>
    <h5>Is it OK to feed my kitten adult food</h5>
    <p>For any cat, to get the best balance of nutrition, we always recommend feeding food that’s specially formulated for their age.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Feeding Guidelines</h3>
    <h5>Can my kitten eat Whiskas Dry Adult food</h5>
    <p>No. Our WHISKAS® Adult Dry Cat Food has been formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles for adult cat maintenance only. We have a kitten formula in our dry line (WHISKAS® Kitten with Chicken) that delivers great taste and that is specially formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles for All Life Stages.</p>
    <h5>My dog likes your Whiskas cat food - Is it OK for him to eat it, too</h5>
    <p>No. Dogs and cats have different nutritional requirements and should be fed food that is formulated for them. However, if your dog accidently eats WHISKAS® Cat Food, your dog should be fine if he is not on any special/restricted diet.</p>
    <h5>How much food should i feed my cat?</h5>
    <p>All of our packs have feeding guidelines to help you work out how much food to feed your cat. We know that every cat is different so yours might need more or less food, according to their own weight, age and how much exercise they do. If you’re unsure you can get in touch with our Consumer Care team.</p>  <br> <br>
